# Trampoline Example

<img src="src/assets/img/icon-128.png" width="64"/>

This is an example project made on the [Trampoline project](https://github.com/plusminushalf/trampoline). Trampoline is a chrome extension boilerplate code to showcase your own Smart Contract Wallets with React 18 and Webpack 5 support.

## Installation and Running

### Steps:

1. Verify that your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **18.12.0**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Make sure you configure the `provider` in `src/exconfig.json` to the `Goerli` network.
4. Edit the `bundler` URL pointing to `Goerli` network and accepting EntryPoint=`0x0576a174D229E3cFA37253523E645A78A0C91B57`
5. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
6. Run `yarn start`
7. Load your extension in Chrome by following these steps:
   1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Enable `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
8. Happy hacking.

### Custom Network

1. Make sure EntryPoint is deployed on the target network.
2. Edit the `entryPointAddress` in `src/exconfig.json`.
3. Add your network details in `hardhat.condig.ts`.
4. Deploy the factory using `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<optional> INFURA_ID=<required> npx hardhat deploy --network <network>`.
5. Edit the `factory_address` in `src/exconfig.json`
6. Edit the `bundler` url in `src/exconfig.json` that points to your network and accepts requests for your EntryPoint.
7. Run `yarn start`

### Local Network

1. Run a local hardhat node with `npx hardhat node` or use the node inside the bundler repo.
2. Deploy EntryPoint from [the infinitism repo](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction), you can find the instrunctions [below](#how-to-deploy-entrypoint-locally).
3. Edit the `entryPointAddress` in `src/exconfig.json`.
4. Deploy the factory using `npx hardhat deploy --network localhost`.
5. Edit the `factory_address` in `src/exconfig.json`
6. Start a local bunder from [the infinitism repo](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler) at port `9000`.
7. Edit the `bundler` to `http://localhost:9000/rpc` url in `src/exconfig.json` that points to your network and accepts requests for your EntryPoint.
8. Run `yarn start`

### How to deploy EntryPoint Locally

1. Clone the repo https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Deploy EntryPoint with `DEBUG=true MNEMONIC_FILE=<path-to-mnemonic-file> yarn deploy --network dev`

### How to run bundler Locally

1. Clone the repo https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn preprocess` to compile all the local dependencies.
4. Edit `bundler.config.json` at `packages/bundler/localconfig`:
   a. Edit `network` to your local hardhat node
   b. Edit the `entryPoint` address that you got while deploying it using instrunctions above.
   c. Change port to `9000`.
   d. Make sure your mnemonic & beneficiary are setup correctly.
5. Run the bunder using `yarn bundler --unsafe --port 9000`

## Extension Structure

1. You can change the icons at `src/assets/img/icon-34.png` and `src/assets/img/icon-128.png` for the chrome extension.

## Wallet Structure

All your extension's account code must be placed in the `src/pages/Account` folder.

There are two subfolders in `src/pages/Account`:

- account-api
- components

### account-api folder

This folder is used to define the `AccountAPI` of your specific account implementation. Every implementation must implement `AccountApiType`.

```typescript
export abstract class AccountApiType extends BaseAccountAPI {
  abstract serialize: () => Promise<object>;

  /** sign a message for the user */
  abstract signMessage: (
    request?: MessageSigningRequest,
    context?: any
  ) => Promise<string>;

  abstract createUnsignedUserOp(
    info: TransactionDetailsForUserOp,
    context?: any
  ): Promise<UserOperationStruct>;
}

export declare abstract class BaseAccountAPI {
  /**
   * return the value to put into the "initCode" field, if the contract is not yet deployed.
   * this value holds the "factory" address, followed by this account's information
   */
  abstract getAccountInitCode(): Promise<string>;
  /**
   * return current account's nonce.
   */
  abstract getNonce(): Promise<BigNumber>;
  /**
   * encode the call from entryPoint through our account to the target contract.
   * @param target
   * @param value
   * @param data
   */
  abstract encodeExecute(
    target: string,
    value: BigNumberish,
    data: string
  ): Promise<string>;
  /**
   * sign a userOp's hash (userOpHash).
   * @param userOpHash
   */
  abstract signUserOpHash(userOpHash: string): Promise<string>;
}
```

The boilerplate includes a SimpleAccountImplementation by Eth-Infinitism, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/SimpleAccountAPI.ts).

### components folder

This folder is used to define the components that will be used in the Chrome extension. This folder should contain two subfolders.

- onboarding
- sign-message
- transaction

The `onboarding` folder defines the component that will be displayed to the user during the creation of a new wallet. You can display custom information or collect user inputs if needed.

The signature of the `OnboardingComponent` is defined as follows.

```typescript
export interface OnboardingComponentProps {
  onOnboardingComplete: (context?: any) => void;
}

export interface OnboardingComponent
  extends React.FC<OnboardingComponentProps> {}
```

Once the component has collected enough information from the user, it should pass the collected information to `onOnboardingComplete` as the `context` parameter. This `context` will be passed on to your `account-api`

The signature of the `account-api` is as follows, which shows how the `context` will be passed:

```typescript
export interface AccountApiParamsType extends BaseApiParams {
  context?: any;
}

export type AccountImplementationType = new (
  params: AccountApiParamsType
) => AccountApiType;
```

The `sign-message` folder defines the component that will be displayed to the user whenever the dapp requests the user to sign any message, i.e. dapp calls `personal_sign` RPC method. You can display custom information or collect user inputs if needed.

The signature of the `SignMessageComponenet` is defined as follows.

```typescript
export interface SignMessageComponenetProps {
  onComplete: (context?: any) => Promise<void>;
}

export interface SignMessageComponenet
  extends React.FC<SignMessageComponenetProps> {}
```

Once the component has collected enough information from the user, it should pass the collected information to `onComplete` as the `context` parameter. This `context` will be passed on to your `signMessage` function of `account-api`

The signature of the `signMessage` is as follows, which shows how the `context` will be passed:

```typescript
  /** sign a message for the user */
  abstract signMessage: (
    request?: MessageSigningRequest,
    context?: any
  ) => Promise<string>;
```

The `transaction` folder defines the component that will be displayed to the user whenever the dapp requests to initiate a transaction, i.e. dapp calls `eth_sendTransaction` RPC method. You can display custom information or collect user inputs if needed.

The signature of the `TransactionComponent` is defined as follows.

```typescript
export interface TransactionComponentProps {
  transaction: EthersTransactionRequest;
  onComplete: (
    modifiedTransaction: EthersTransactionRequest,
    context?: any
  ) => Promise<void>;
}

export interface TransactionComponent
  extends React.FC<TransactionComponentProps> {}
```

Once the component has collected enough information from the user, it should pass the collected information to `onComplete` as the `context` parameter. You can also modify the transaction if you want and return it also as a parameter of `onComplete` function. This `context` and `modifiedTransaction` will be passed on to your `createUnsignedUserOp` function of `account-api`

The signature of the `createUnsignedUserOp` is as follows, which shows how the `context` will be passed:

```typescript
  /** sign a message for the user */
  abstract createUnsignedUserOp: (
    request?: MessageSigningRequest,
    context?: any
  ) => Promise<string>;
```

If you want you can also attach a paymaster here if your wallet wants to sponsor the transaction as well. The paymaster information will be displayed to the user.

## Config

Config of the extension can be set in `excnfig.json` file.

```json
{
  // Enable or disable password for the user.
  "enablePasswordEncryption": true,
  // Show default transaction screen
  "showTransactionConfirmationScreen": true,
  // Network that your SCW supports. Currently this app only supports a single network, we will soon have support for multiple networks in future
  "network": {
    "chainID": "5",
    "family": "EVM",
    "name": "Goerli",
    "provider": "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/bdabe9d2f9244005af0f566398e648da",
    "entryPointAddress": "0x0F46c65C17AA6b4102046935F33301f0510B163A",
    "bundler": "https://app.stackup.sh/api/v1/bundler/96771b1b09e802669c33a3fc50f517f0f514a40da6448e24640ecfd83263d336",
    "baseAsset": {
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "name": "ETH",
      "decimals": 18,
      "image": "https://ethereum.org/static/6b935ac0e6194247347855dc3d328e83/6ed5f/eth-diamond-black.webp"
    }
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### Is the password screen mandatory?

No you can disable that by setting `enablePasswordEncryption` flag to `false` in `exconfig.json`.

> **Warning:** the local storage will be unencrypted and your wallet must return an encrypted state when `serialize` function of `account-api` willo be called or else the user's fund will be at risk.

### Is the view transaction screen mandatory?

If you want to show a custom screen then you must present it to the user in `TransactionComponent` and set `showTransactionConfirmationScreen` to `false`.

### How do I, as a wallet provider attach a custom paymaster?

You must return the paymaster information in the `userOp` constructed by the function `createUnsignedUserOp`.

> **Warnming:** If `showTransactionConfirmationScreen` has been disabled then the user will not be aware of paymaster and you must inform the user about paymaster in your custom transaction confirmation screen.
